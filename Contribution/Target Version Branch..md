##### Current Target Version Branch
Branch : v1.0  | (v1.0.0)

We follow target version branching structure. It's basically making a branch to reach a specific target version number and we keep patching it incrementally i.e for version 1.0 we have branch v1.0 and all the sub-branches will be child of this and should be merged into this.
