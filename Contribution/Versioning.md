NOTE : If your feature is breaking then feel free to reach out to us and we will help you make a separate target version branch if required. 
```

For version numbers we follow the following structure Semantic Versioning. The version is structured as:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

Here’s what each part represents:

1. **MAJOR** (first number, e.g., `0`):  Increments when you make incompatible API changes or introduce major new functionality.  A MAJOR version bump typically signals that previous versions may not work with this one.

2. **MINOR** (second number, e.g., `0`):  Increments when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner. This means new features are introduced without breaking existing functionality.

3. **PATCH** (third number, e.g., `0`):  Increments when you make backward-compatible bug fixes. It typically involves minor changes that don’t introduce new features or break existing ones but fix issues.

### In a Version `0.0.0`:

**0.0.0** is typically used in early development when no stable, usable version of the software has been released yet.

- `0.x.y` indicates that the software is in development and potentially unstable.
- `0.0.x` might be for early patches during pre-release development, and the version `0.0.0` can indicate the project is at its initial state or not fully functional yet.
