## Ideas Behind Oi 💡

Oi was created with a vision to make code generation more accessible, flexible, and efficient for developers:

1. 🚀 **IDE Independence**: Oi allows code generation on any IDE, making it a flexible, IDE-independent tool.
2. 🛠 **Control Over Code Context**: Oi gives developers control over what parts of their project are used for context during code generation.
3. 💸 **Low/No-Cost Open-Source Solution**: We're building Oi as a no/low-cost, open-source CLI tool.
